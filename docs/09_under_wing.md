A chapter where Ace of Acid gets back home from Big Oriental City by airplane.

>lyrics

    the engine's humming under wing
    i've failed to get the diamond ring
    i've failed to give what was required
    now i am going back quite tired

    we were not aimed for each other
    no reason left more to bother
    we're independent and free
    time to calm down and agree
    
    the engine's humming under wing
    the queen's intended for the king
    at first you've tried to play the ace
    but this attempt had left no trace
    
    we were not aimed for each other
    no reason left more to bother
    we're independent and free
    time to calm down and agree
