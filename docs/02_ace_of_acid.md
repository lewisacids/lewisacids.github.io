A first chapter where the Ace of Acid meets the Queen of Diamonds

> lyrics

    Big oriental city nights
    Are in your soul, are in your soul
    Rock solid beats and disco lights
    Are in your soul, are in your soul
    Synth-pop, post-punk and rock'n'roll
    Are in your soul, are in your soul
    And summer, winter spring and fall
    You need it all, you need it all!
    
    On every street, in every bus
    All your base are belong to us.
    Give me a sign, so I could trace it,
    I'm bound to be your Ace of Acid.
    
    Ace of Acid!...
    
    The bass the drums the synth the mix
    Are in your soul, are in your soul
    A forgery for solid beats
    Where fire burns to melt it all
    Acoustic waves and MIDI streams
    Are in your soul, are in your soul
    To implement all opf your dreams
    You need it all, you need it all
    
    On every street, in every bus
    All your base are belong to us.
    I'll give a sign, so you could trace it,
    And you'll become my Ace of Acid.
    
    Ace of Acid!...
    Ace of Acid!...
    Ace of Acid!...
