A chapter that tell Inorganic nature of Queen of Diamonds that is not compatible with
Ace of Acid.

> lyrics

    Though I know exactly that all I try's in vain,
    I continue trying more and more like manic.
    Every time I see you, I fall in love again,
    Though I know you are completely inorganic.
    
    carbon based life
    stems from the roots
    of ancient nature
    minerals lie
    in endless youth
    they won't get mature
    
    First time when we've met, it already appeared
    That I will have no chane to complete my mission.
    But I anyway am happy with you here;
    Maybe I was fooled by your composition
    
    carbon based life
    stems from the roots
    of ancient nature
    minerals lie
    in endless youth
    they won't get mature
    
    It's not good for us to set collision course
    I'm about to crash into you like Titanic.
    Carbon's sign of life in our Universe;
    You're pure carbon but completely inorganic
    
    My spectral data will confirm
    I am in perfect crystal form
    Your spectrum is a mess of lines
    You're not quiet pure as it defines.
