> lyrics

    I'm not a kind of guy
    You're looking for in life,
    I've knew it right away
    When my airplane arrived.
    It goes much better when
    We're thousands miles apart
    And our relation failed
    From almost very start
    
    Remove me from your drives,
    Remove me from your cloud.
    The only my advice
    For you is wipe me out.
    Remove me from your life,
    Remove me from your head,
    Don't care if I'm alive
    Or if I'm dead
    
    I'm not a kind of girl
    That you are looking for.
    I'm different at all,
    From surface to the core.
    You're not an atom that
    I'll put to crystal grid.
    Though I don't want to let
    You heart to hurt and bleed
    
    Remove me from your drives,
    Remove me from your cloud.
    The only my advice
    For you is wipe me out.
    Remove me from your life,
    Remove me from your head,
    Don't care if I'm alive
    Or if I'm dead
    
    You are not hot enough
    For my heart to ignite
    I'm worse then Ninety One,
    I'm worse then Scriptonite.
    
    You are not to be fair
    Galym Moldanazar
    Nobody will compare
    To him as pop rock star
    
    Remove me from your drives,
    Remove me from your cloud.
    The only my advice
    For you is wipe me out.
    Remove me from your life,
    Remove me from your head,
    Don't care if I'm alive
    Or if I'm dead
