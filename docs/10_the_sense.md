> lyrics

    I came back to the Moscow town and took a train back home
    At least I told my self it ain't so bad to be alone
    Despite the winter in the street there was a pouring rain
    And suddenly I've realized while waiting for the train...
    
    There is a sense!
    In cynic mind and in romance,
    There is a sense!
    In hard rock and progressive trance
    There is a sense!
    In flamenco and bellydance
    In army and of course civil defence...
    There is a sense!
    A lot of a sense!
    
    My life got even better now as it goes on so far
    I've setup a relation with Galym Moldanazar
    At least we work together and both are doing fine
    And who knows what is waiting us bit further down the line
    
    I've also moved on further and have got a better life
    I've found an asian beauty who will now become my wife
    We had a good time with you but now our story ends
    But though we know exactly that...
    
    There is a sense!
    In cynic mind and in romance,
    There is a sense!
    In hard rock and progressive trance
    There is a sense!
    In flamenco and bellydance
    In army and of course civil defence...
    There is a sense!
    A lot of a sense!
    
    There is a sense!
    A sense in everywhere and all
    The shining sense
    The one you can see through the walls
    The perfect sense
    The only meaning of your life
    More powerful than VL-85!
