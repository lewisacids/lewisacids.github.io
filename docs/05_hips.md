A chapter about sweet hips of Queen of Diamonds as she dances on the session
in the center of Big Oriental City.

> lyrics

    Ref.
    the heart of the city is beating with powerful bass
    the dance floor is rocking like ship on the ocean waves
    this night is our prize for our busy and dull working days
    it's burning with passion
    so let's join the session
    let's unite our nations
    let's finally dance!

    the speaker play one of the modern dance hits
    so dance to it honey and move your sweet hips
    rock them to the snare drum, shake them to the bass
    they perfectly fit all your features of face
    
    I imagine them spread and like them together
    they look so attractive in trousers of leather
    they're soft but they cut me as sharp as a razor
    they're hot, like a powerful solid state laser
 
    the heart of the city is beating with powerful bass
    the dance floor is rocking like ship on the ocean waves
    this night is our prize for our busy and dull working days
    it's burning with passion
    so let's join the session
    let's unite our nations
    let's finally dance!

    you could write a better song, if you were clever,
    life formâ€™s temporary but diamond's forever
    you can't see the soul that is driving my body
    you've got very much at the moment to study

    I've knew you online before met in reality
    first thing that I've knew of you was personality
    so wait to accuse me cause I want to tell
    I like your hips much but though your soul as well

    I like the direction that your thoughts are taking
    my hips do not lie, but they're maybe mistaking
    they need some more time to decide what is right
    so we can relax now and dance overnight

    the heart of the city is beating with powerful bass
    the dance floor is rocking like ship on the ocean waves
    this night is our prize for our busy and dull working days
    it's burning with passion
    so let's join the session
    let's unite our nations
    let's finally dance!
