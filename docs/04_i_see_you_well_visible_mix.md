A chapter where Ace of Acid sees Queen of Diamonds for the first time, though very well.

> lyrics

    From the school to the present days wearing the glass,
    I have caught your eye right away nevertheless.
    You were shining like diamond and bright as the star,
    And I've knew right away just how perfect you are..
    
    I see you well as an eagle,
    My eyes are sharp as a needle
    They resolve details better
    Than electron microscope.
    I see you better than sunlight,
    This is a feeling I can't fight,
    My mind is following my heart
    All way down this slope
    
    All my life from the birth and until present days
    I was wandering blind like lost in a maze
    But when you came along and appeared in my life,
    All my sight became flooded with powerful light...
    
    I see you well as an eagle,
    My eyes are sharp as a needle
    They resolve details better
    Than electron microscope.
    I see you better than sunlight,
    This is a feeling I can't fight,
    My mind is following my heart
    All way down this slope
