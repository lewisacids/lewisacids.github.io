A chapter where Love over Ethernet turns to visiting IRL

> lyrics

    We're not together now
    Far from each other like hell
    Though we've got ethernet,
    Though we've got xDSL
    
    The bounding channel is so clear
    That it appears we're getting near
    That it appears we're getting close
    Addiction leads to overdoze
    
    Each one of us's alone
    Locked in his own virtual cell
    Love over ethernet
    Sex over xDSL
    
    I wish to see you face to face
    To make a queen react with ace
    It's not impossibly big deal
    Oh how I wish to make it real
    
    It's time now to decide
    It's time to transfer myself
    With no more ethernet
    And no more xDSL
