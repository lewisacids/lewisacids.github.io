A chapter about a special feeling that Ace of Acid experiences to Queen of Diamonds.
She turns him on to Solid State Drive, being certainly Solid State herself like any other Diamond.

> lyrics

    Your name is one I always call
    You are the rock I wanna roll
    You are the love of whole my life
    You turn me on to solid state drive
    You turn me on to solid state drive
    
    I've got my back against the wall
    You are the rock I wanna roll
    I want you to become my wife
    You turn me on to solid state drive
    You turn me on to solid state drive
    
    You are the air for me to breathe
    And if the world was swarm of bees
    You were the queen that rules the hive
    You turn me on to solid state drive
    You turn me on to solid state drive
    
    I will surrender to my fate
    As you turn me to solid state
    I know together w—É will thrive
    You turn me on to solid state drive
    You turn me on to solid state drive
